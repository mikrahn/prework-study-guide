# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I prepared the prework-study guide as a learning experience and primer course for the UCONN Coding Bootcamp.
- I built the simple website to learn some of the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript
- The prework-study-guide website allows me to see at-a-glance, the component coding languages that most modern websites comprise.
- While preparing this homework assignment, I was able to see how HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript work together to structure the content, style the content, maintain version control, and allow users to interact with the website to solve a problem.

## Installation

# N/A

## Usage

A beginning web-development coder should be able to use this website to view the major components of a modern web page and understand from the notes, what each component does. The student can also use 'inspect' functionality of Google Chrome to view the HTML, CSS, and Javascript components in detail. The JavaScript console in Chrome can also be used to see the JavaScript in action and test out additional JavaScript functionality at the REPL.
